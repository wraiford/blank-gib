            <h1>Looking for fing interesting people</h1>

            <aside>ibgib is a genuine moonshot</aside>

            <p>

                Ibgib is a highly innovative and experimental design to DLT and
                human-AI collaboration, and the foundation of an entirely new
                business model. Upside is high, but so is the risk. That's what
                makes it so fing interesting. So we're looking for fing
                interesting people.

        <p>

            Ibgib's unique protocol focuses on spacetime. This is not a gimmick,
            as time is a first-class citizen even moreso than version control.
            And architecturally speaking, our timelines enables a whole new
            approach to front end-back end paradigms. We're looking for
            experienced people who are ready to actually innovate the front end
            at a fundamental level based on this premise.

        <h3>Architectural Details for Frontend Innovation</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>

                <b>DLT Redux</b>: Each ibgib is like a monotonoically-increasing
                mini-repo. They're like a Merkle-DAG based append-only log.
                Each component has a backing model of one of these ibgibs. So we
                get a redux-like design but tied to a decentralized, DLT-based
                data model.

            </li>

            <li>

                <b>Agent-backed</b>: Agents suck at complex projects - but
                append-only because we haven't shifted our "version control"
                paradigm. The front end itself is an interface to high-velocity,
                ratcheting version control akin to a movie being a high
                framerate of individual pics. Agents and humans collaborate with
                agents and humans in a new paradigm.

            </li>

            <li>

                <b>Command based</b>: Currently we have a central commanding architecture
                that plugs into the agentic function calling. There are no `eval` calls.

            </li>

            <li>

                <b>Dynamic UX</b>: We have started down the road of an
                agent-backed, canvas-based, dynamic rendering engine. The shell
                itself is HTML. Agents+Humans generate artifacts that evolve in
                the unique ibgib version control and propagate throughout the
                distributed data space.

            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Recommended Qualifications</h3>

                JavaScript/TypeScript </li>
            <li>Strong understanding of frontend architecture patterns, state
                management principles, and rendering performance in the browser</li>
            <li>Experience with API integration, including understanding of
                different communication paradigms</li>
            <li>Ability to think critically about complex user interface
                problems and translate them into scalable and maintainable code</li>
            <li>Experience with frontend testing/debugging strategies/tools</li>
            <li>Experience with or understanding of concepts in distributed
                systems, concurrency, or data synchronization relevant to frontend
                applications</li>
            <li>Smart, patient, with moderate-but-manageable insanity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preferred Qualifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Familiarity with AI agents, interactive systems, or designing interfaces for complex automated
                processes
            </li>
            <li>Experience with dynamic form generation, schema-driven UI development, or meta-programming in a frontend
                context</li>
            <li>Experience with existing modern frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte) and a critical

        <h3>Why this role is unique</h3>
        <p>This isn't a standard frontend role. You'll be working on the foundational layer of a system that tightly
            integrates UI with distributed data and intelligent agents. If you're passionate about building powerful
            developer tools and tackling novel challenges in frontend architecture, this is an opportunity to have a
            significant impact.</p>

        <h2>Senior Distributed Systems Engineer (or Backend Engineer with Distributed Systems Experience)</h2>
        <p>The type of work we're doing here, dealing with distributed systems, concurrency, data consistency, and
            application-level logic within that framework, touches on several areas of expertise. If you were to hire
            someone for this kind of role, you'd likely be looking for a Distributed Systems Engineer or a Backend
            Engineer
            with Distributed Systems Experience.</p>

        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing and maintaining distributed data structures.</li>
            <li>Developing and optimizing concurrency control mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Ensuring data consistency and integrity.</li>
            <li>Designing and implementing distributed algorithms.</li>
            <li>Monitoring and performance tuning.</li>
            <li>Working with distributed infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required Qualifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Distributed Systems Concepts.</li>
            <li>Concurrency Control.</li>
            <li>Data Modeling and Management.</li>
            <li>Backend Development.</li>
            <li>Networking.</li>
            <li>System Design.</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting and Debugging.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preferred Qualifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Experience with CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types).</li>
            <li>Knowledge of gossip protocols or other decentralized communication patterns.</li>
            <li>Experience with event-driven architectures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Desirable Qualities</h3>
        <p>Experience with CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types): Given the nature of ibGibs and their potential
            for
            concurrent modifications, experience with CRDTs or similar data structures that handle conflicts gracefully
            would be highly valuable. Knowledge of gossip protocols or other decentralized communication patterns: This
            could be relevant if you explore more decentralized approaches to data synchronization. Experience with
            event-driven architectures: Distributed systems often leverage eventing for communication and coordination.
